    <h1>Welcome to Weston Moffat's CSD120 Website!</h1>
    <p>As a bright&dash;eyed student graduating from high school in 2013, I imagined myself as a successful lawyer, living it up in 
    some city in the not so distant future. Law class was my favourite subject in high school, so naturally, I assumed this was the
    best course of action. Initially enrolled in political science at The University of Western Ontario, I quickly made the
    switch to philosophy after being introduced to the thought&dash;provoking ideas and arguments of political philosophers such
    as Locke and Mill. Lawyers deal with rational and logical arguments on a daily basis, and philosophy could aid me in developing 
    these skills.</p>
    <p>Studying philosophy provided me with a new worldview; a different lens to view life. It was in my second year of university 
    that I determined I no longer wished to be a lawyer. If you asked me exactly what prompted this decision, I wouldn't be able
    to base it on one factor; rather a plethora of influences and circumstances. The question now arose: <em>&ldquo;What could I
    possibly do with a philosophy degree?&rdquo;</em> As intriguing and interesting that I find philosophy, I couldn't quite picture 
    myself spending eight years in university to get my PhD and teach. While being a professor enticed me, I couldn't find it in 
    myself to put so much of my life into that discipline. However, it will always remain a lifelong passion. Just not at the forefront
    of my life.</p>
    <p>Maybe the most overwhelming factor of deciding not to become a lawyer, was my focus on the monetary gains it provided and not the 
    passion I had for it. Thus, I now needed to establish where this passion was and how I can spend my life doing it. I took a year and 
    and a half hiatius from my studies, and now, here I am: studying computer programming at Sault College. I concluded that computer
    science was the domain to focus my time on. After extensive research over that year, I honestly think I've found a discipline that
    I'll enjoy, without considering how much money I'll make in the end. Not saying that isn't a factor; merely not a necessity.</p>
    <p>Beyond the scope of philosophy, and now computer science, I enjoy reading, writing, playing video games, and spending time with
    my dog. I grew up in Thessalon, not far from Sault Ste. Marie, and so I'm much closer to home than I was during my time at Western.
    I'm looking forward to my studies at Sault College, and hopefully Algoma University afterwards.</p>
    <p>Welcome to my very first website!</p>
