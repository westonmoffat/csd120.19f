      <p>As a bright&dash;eyed student graduating from high school in 2013, I imagined myself as a successful lawyer, living it up 
      in some city in the not so distant future. Law class was my favourite subject in high school, so naturally, I assumed this 
      was the best course of action. Initially enrolled in political science at The University of Western Ontario, I quickly made 
      the switch to philosophy after being introduced to the thought&dash;provoking ideas and arguments of political philosophers 
      such as Locke and Mill. Lawyers deal with rational and logical arguments on a daily basis, and philosophy could aid me in 
      developing these skills.</p>
      <p>Studying philosophy provided me with a new worldview; a different lens to view life. It was in my second year of 
      university that I determined I no longer wished to be a lawyer. If you asked me exactly what prompted this decision, I 
      wouldn't be ablecto base it on one factor; rather a plethora of influences and circumstances. The question now arose: 
      <em>&ldquo;What could I possibly do with a philosophy degree?&rdquo;</em> As intriguing and interesting that I find 
      philosophy, I couldn't quite picture myself spending eight years in university to get my PhD and teach. While being a 
      professor enticed me, I couldn't find it in myself to put so much of my life into that discipline. However, it will always 
      remain a lifelong passion. Just not at the forefront of my life.</p>
      <p>Maybe the most overwhelming factor of deciding not to become a lawyer, was my focus on the monetary gains it provided 
      and not the passion I had for it. Thus, I now needed to establish where this passion was and how I can spend my life doing 
      it. I took a year and and a half hiatius from my studies, and now, here I am: studying computer programming at Sault College.
      I concluded that computer science was the domain to focus my time on. After extensive research over that year, I honestly 
      think I've found a discipline that I'll enjoy, without considering how much money I'll make in the end. Not saying that 
      isn't a factor; merely not a necessity.</p>
      <p>Beyond the scope of philosophy, and now computer science, I enjoy reading, writing, playing video games, and spending 
      time with my dog. I grew up in Thessalon, not far from Sault Ste. Marie, and so I'm much closer to home than I was during 
      my time at Western. I'm looking forward to my studies at Sault College, and hopefully Algoma University afterwards.</p>
      <p>Welcome to my very first website!</p>
